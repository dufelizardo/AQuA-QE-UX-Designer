# Contributing Guide

Thanks for considering contributing to **AQuA-QE UX Designer**! Before anything else, it's worth reading `WHITEPAPER.en.md` (or `WHITEPAPER.md` in Portuguese) and `docs/agent/` to understand what the agent does and why.

## Reporting issues

- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/dufelizardo/AQuA-QE-UX-Designer/issues) before opening a new one.
- If it looks like a known gap, check the [Backlog project](https://github.com/users/dufelizardo/projects/6) first — it may already be there, deliberately deferred until a real consumer shows up.
- When reporting a bug, include: steps to reproduce, expected vs. observed behavior, the two input sources used (`--confluence`/`--jira`, both always required in this agent), and the active LLM provider (`LLM_PROVIDER`, if different from the `ollama` default).

## Proposing changes (Pull Requests)

- For a large change, open an issue first describing what you intend to do.
- Prefer small, focused PRs — avoid mixing a bug fix with a new feature.
- **This repository has no lint/type-check config of its own** (`ruff`/`basedpyright` only exist at the root of the monorepo this project originated from) — there's nothing to run here.
- Run `uv sync` then `uv run pytest` before opening the PR. The entire suite is mocked — no test makes a real call to Ollama/Jira/Confluence/Qdrant; a PR that needs real network access to pass a test will not be accepted.
- Any change to a generator/reviewer skill must preserve the `generate → validate (Python checklist) → review (second, independent LLM) → [refine, human-in-the-loop] → explicit human acceptance` cycle. No skill or workflow may set `ArtifactStatus.ACCEPTED` on its own — that's always a human act in `run.py`.
- Changes that let a skill invent data outside the input source, or bypass human review, are rejected. This agent's most critical guardrail is **GR-UX-4** (never generate Personas or User Journeys — those already exist in the Product Manager's PRD; `extract_ux_context` only cites them literally as context, never regenerates them) — see `docs/agent/guardrails.md` for the full set (GR-UX-1 through GR-UX-4).
- If the change affects observable behavior, also update the relevant docs: `docs/agent/*`, `README.md`/`README.pt.md`, `WHITEPAPER.md`/`WHITEPAPER.en.md`, and the diagrams in `docs/architecture/` (draw.io + SVG) if the flow changed.

## Development environment

```bash
# Python 3.12+ and uv already installed
ollama pull mistral   # generation
ollama pull phi4      # independent review
ollama pull bge-m3    # embeddings (institutional refinement memory)

uv sync
cp .env.example .env  # fill in to use --jira/--confluence (required in this agent)

uv run pytest
```

## Pull Request process

1. Fork the repository, branch from `main`.
2. Make the change, with tests covering the new behavior.
3. `uv run pytest` locally before opening the PR.
4. Describe the change in the PR, referencing the related issue (e.g. "Closes #12").
5. Wait for review — be open to adjustments, especially around the guardrails.

- [Discussions](https://github.com/dufelizardo/AQuA-QE-UX-Designer/discussions) — start with the "Welcome to AQuA-QE UX Designer" post.
- [Backlog project](https://github.com/users/dufelizardo/projects/6) — what's deliberately out of scope for this phase.
